# cthulhu-npc
A non-playing character generator set in the classic Call of Cthulhu years, the late 1920s.

Are you a game director who likes improvising? Has any of your NPCs suddenly grown in relevance to the plot? Is it often the case that you have to create your characters background on the fly, becoming a projection of yourself?

Fret no longer, fellow game director. The Cthulhy NPC generator is here to help you. This software will automatically create characters with their own names, set of values and familiar background to enrich your sessions without any effort from your side!
